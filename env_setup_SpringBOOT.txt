SPRING BOOT is a tool which allows us to create SPRING based applications which are
STAND-ALONE
PRODUCTION-GRADE (not merely a Hello World !)
JUST_RUN principle


LIMITATIONS of SPRING , MIND it's SPRING not SPRING BOOT
Huge framework which can do a lot......Comes with flexibility and functionality but at a cost
Multiple setup/config steps



SETTING UP
.JAVA JDK

.SPRING STS (Tool Suite)                   or              Eclipse IDE
..  from  :  https://spring.io/tools/sts/

    NOTE  : PLEASE MAKE SURE OF YOUR VERSION OF ECLIPSE and then DOWNLOAD

..  The Spring Tool Suite is an Eclipse-based development environment that is customized for developing Spring applications.
    It parses your configuration files and displays detailed information about the beans that are being define.
    It provides a comprehensive set of validations that are being applied automatically
    Spring Tool Suite provides you with meaningful content-assist all over the place
..  Extract and run STS.exe.

.MAVEN
..  from  :  https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
..  It is a BUILD DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT TOOL, which allows us to include all libs reqd by specifying in "pom.xml" file
    and later MAVEN extracts all these dependencies/jars from a REPO instead of MANUAL DOWNLOADING .jars and including in proj
..  Extract and add \bin dir value (eg:- D:\apache-maven-3.5.4\bin) to PATH var in edit SYSTEM/ACCOUNT variables.
    Make sure "JAVA_HOME" is set to the location of your JDK

                    in edit SYSTEM/ACCOUNT variables.
    Run "mvn --version" to verify

.GRADLE



NEW PROJECT
. OPEN STS (Tool suite)    or    Eclipse IDE

. CREATE a new GRADLE project or MAVEN project

. for PROXY settings configure settings.xml (MAVEN) OR gradle.properties (GRADLE) file in root folder of PROJECT

. Configure DEPENDENCIES in pom.xml (MAVEN) or build.gradle (GRADLE) with groupID (PACKAGE NAME) , artifactID (PROJECT NAME) , VERSION
..   for creating a .war a this(s) file is required
..   This can be done by copying the required complie line from   ""https://mvnrepository.com/""


. DOWNLOAD all required .jars from    "https://mvnrepository.com/"    or   "https://jar-download.com/"
..   Required for LOCAL MACHINE run.
...     spring-boot-starter-parent     and    spring-boot-starter
...     spring-boot-starter-web
...     spring-core

. To tell IDE that run it as a SPRINGBOOT proj use annotation :
@SpringBootApplication  for the mainclass
@RestController         for a controllerclass to be searched by APP
@RequestMapping         for mapping URL(s) for controllerclass
@Autowired              for injecting a class in other via var
@Service                for registering a class as Service
@PathVariable           for supplying value in url var to method var
@RequestBody            for converting content received via POST request to an instance of class


. NOTE  :  Application requires to be relaunched to see necessary changes , STOP and RUN , else will generate error of cannot connect on port (already in use)


. SpringApplication.run() is a static class with static method "run()"  which
..   sets default config
..   starts springApplication context
..   Performs Classpath scan.... like Annotation scan   etc..
..   Starts TOMCAT server....... NO NEED to install , it comes with builtin service for it.


.REQUESTS

.. GET

.. POST  :  done via POSTMAN , get application from CHROMESTORE
            change method to POST  (CREATE request)
            enter desired url to send request to   (configured in controllerclass)
            go to HEADERS tab and add key CONTENT-TYPE value application/json
            go to BODY tab and add your json key-val pairs as a RAW data by selecting RAW radiobutton

.. PUT   :  It is an UPDATE request

.. DELETE



.OTHER ALTERNATIVES to BOOTING a SPRING PROJ

..   SPRING INITIALIzr    :    "https://start.spring.io/"
..   SPRINGBOOT CLI       :    "https://spring.io/"
..   STS IDE              :     Create a new SPRING STARTER PROJECT



.CONFIGURING PROPERTIES OF APPLICATION   ( server.port , debug etc... )

..   use "application.properties"  file  and  configure properties as a key=value pair.
     example : set SERVER PORT using server.port key

..   REFER   "https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html"   for keys



.SPRING DATA JPA    (DATABASE - CRUD)
..   It (JAVA Persistence API) is a framework which uses ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for DATABASE and OBJECT(s) mapping.
..   Include DERBY (DATABASE)              .jars  and  compile statement in build.gradle
..   Include SPRING_BOOT_STARTER_DATA_JPA  .jars  and  compile statement in build.gradle
..   Include JAVAX.PERSISTENCE             .jars  and  compile statement in build.gradle

..   CONFIGURE ENTITY ie a class that contains desired member vars for table columns using
...      @Entity     :  REGISTER as an ENTITY for making member vars as columns in TABLE entity
...      @Id         :  REGISTER desired member var as a PRIMARY key

..   CONFIGURE a JPA REPOSITORY "INTERFACE" not class , by extending CrudRepository<ENTITY_CLASS , PRIMARY_KEY_DATA_TYPE>
...      It comes with SPRING-JPA
...      Include   org.springframework.data : spring-data-commons  .jars   and   build.gradle  compile statement
...      Create a member var of this REPOSITORY INTERFACE in SERVICE CLASS    with    @Autowired
