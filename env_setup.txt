1. On a new project in EclipseIDE

. either select already existing userlib or create NEW (name userlib)  ---> Add external jars ---> add SPRING and APACHE_COMMON_LOGGINGS jars from downloaded files above



--------------------------------------------------------------------------NOTES-------------------------------------------------

1. SPRING uses SPRING BEAN FACTORY to maintain OBJECT LIFECYCLE.
   Each bean is CONFIGURED with a class and CONFIGURED for a object.
   The factory uses the XML file to generate/configure a bean and then later refer to the object.
   "spring.xml" file must be in classpath ie src for ApplicationContext



2. DEPENDENCY INJECTION is the most powerful feature of SPRING
.  SETTER INJECTION
.  CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION
.  OBJECT INJECTION



3. INNER BEANS
.  if a bean (object) is specific to be referenced for a specific bean (object) then use following syntax

<bean id="" class="">

  <property name="" ref=""></property>                  <!-- reference to external bean -->

  <property name="">                                    <!-- use of inner beans without ref-->

   <bean class="">
     <property name="" value=""></property>    
     <property name="" value=""></property>
   </bean>

  </property>

</bean>



4. ALIAS
use of another name of bean id as follows

<alias name="actual_bean_id"  alias="alias_id"></alias>



5. IDREF
use idref to make sure a id exist for the reference made. It will throw error if the bean with that id does not exist.

<property name="">

<idref="id_of_bean"></idref>

</property>



6. USING COLLECTIONS
use List, Hash, Map tools in SPRING

<property name="">

 <list>                        <!-- define list tag and give reference(s)/value(s) -->

  <ref bean=""></ref>          <!-- give reference to bean id -->
  <ref bean=""></ref>
  <ref bean=""></ref>

 </list>

</property>



7. BEAN AUTOWIRING
Avoids use of giving reference/property for each bean. Default is <bean autowire="off"></bean>
Can be done by specifying 'autowire' attribute in '<bean>' tag of class where reference is required , with values as:

a) "byName"  -  If name (id) of beans to be referenced is same as of member variables of class where they are required to be referenced.

b) "byType"  -  If a class (type) has only one member var of ref class it automatically wires that var with bean of that ref class.

c) "constructor"  -  Requires a constructor for autowiring , but class must have only one ref class var of ref bean.



8. BEAN SCOPES
scope of bean existence. Modified using 'scope' attribute of '<bean>' tag , with values as:

a) singleton  -  same instance for each .getbean("id") of same id passed to class object

b) prototype  -  a new instance is created for each reference or .getbean("id")

c) request    -  new bean per servlet request

d) global     -  new bean per session

e) session    -  new bean per global HTTP session



9. AWARE INTERFACES
used to make application aware of that they are called. They are "implemented" with the classname

a) ApplicationContextAware
use of bean context in class , same as if using SPRING's .xml wiring

b) BeanNameAware
use of bean name (id) when called



10. BEAN DEFINITION INHERITANCE
bean defn can be inherited to be used within another bean using 'parent' attribute of <bean> tag and using "id" of bean defn to be inherited as value to 'parent' attrib.



11. LIFECYCLE CALLBACKS
An interface(s) that can be implemented similar to constructor and destructor for a bean.
Requires AbstractApplicationContext  and  context.registerShutdownHook()   in mainjavaFILE (drawingapp.java) file

a) InitializingBean Interface
constructor method for bean   :  afterPropertiesSet()               defined in bean configured class

b) DisposableBean Interface
destructor method for bean    :  destroy()                          defined in bean configured class

-----------------------------we can use user defined constructor/destructor-------------------------------
use following attributes of "<bean>" tag with values as "custom_func_name" , NOTE : func must be defined within the bean configured class.
 
c) 'init-method'

d) 'destroy-method'

-----------------------------default constructor/destructor applicable to all beans can also be configured-----------
use following attributes of "<beans>" tag with values as "custom_func_name" , NOTE : func can be defined in any bean configured class since it is common to all beans.

e) 'default-init-method'

f) 'default-destroy-method'

NOTE : If both user defined and SPRING DEPENDENT constructor/destructor are used , SPRING dependent will be given priority.



12. BeanPostProcessor
A method can be defined for a bean such that they are called BEFORE and AFTER initialization of all bean(s).
Requires methods : postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName)   and    postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName)



13. INTERFACE CODING
To make use of interface for calling (BEAN) classes accordingly in place of modifying the Class and Object for call.



14. ANNOTATIONS
JSR 250 is a Java Specification Request with the objective to develop annotations (ie. information about a software program that is not part of the program itself).

a) @Required                                   (exception handling for a reqd member var)  (used with setter method)
                                               (Requires corresponding BeanPostProcessorClass bean defined in XML file for checking Annotations before bean init.)

b) @Resource(name="id_of_bean")     xx         (provide a resource for member var instead of providing in property tag of bean)  (used with setter method)

c) @Resource                        xx         (if member var and bean id name are same, use this)

d) @PostConstruct                   xx         (Constructor from Annotations) (used with user defn func)

e) @PreDestroy                      xx         (Destructor from Annotations)  (used with user defn func)

--------------------------------------------------------STEREOTYPE ANNOTATIONS-----------------------------------------------------------
conforming to a fixed or general pattern; especially : a standardized picture
(Requires   <context:component-scan base-package="your_package_name"/>   to be defined in XML)  (used with class defn)

f) @Component                                  (Notifies Spring container that this class is a bean, eliminates use of <bean></bean> defn in XML)
                                               
g) @Controller                                 (Notifies Spring container that this class is a Controller)

h) @Service                                    (Notifies Spring container that this class is a Service)

i) @Repository                                 (Notifies Spring container that this class is a Repository)



15. MESSAGESOURCE
It is used to get the messages text from .properties file , NOTE : .properties file must be in classpath ie src
Define bean in .xml file for messageSource
Call in the required class using   context.getMessage(key, param_vals, default_val, locale_file_name)  in class with Main func

To call in a class which is not having Main func use : "MessageSource msgsrc_var"  declaration with setters and getters
                                                       either use @Autowired or use ref of MessageSource Bean for property of var in class to initialize var
                                                       use this.msgsrc_var.getMessage(key , new Object[] {center.getX(), center.getY()} , default_val , locale_file_name)
                                                       
Use {0} {1} {2} ... for param_vals args and not harcoded strings in .properties file

locale_file_name is useful in case of referring to .properties file other than specified in bean ie it will override.
